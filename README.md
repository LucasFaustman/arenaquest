## How It's Made:

**Tech used:**
C#, ASP.NET Core, Razor Pages, Entity Framework Core, SQL Server

In this project, I wanted to practice my skills with C#, ASP.NET Core, and Entity Framework Core, as well as learn how to build a web application using these technologies.

ArenaQuest allows users to track the sports games and arenas they have attended, as well as add comments and ratings for each game and arena.

## Optimizations

- Add a feature to display user's statistics, such as the number of games attended or the average rating

- Add a map to display the location of each arena

- Add user profiles

## Lessons Learned:

Through this project, I learned several concepts related to C#, ASP.NET Core, and Entity Framework Core, including:

- How to use Razor Pages to build web pages with C# code

- How to use Entity Framework Core to interact with a SQL Server database

- How to use LINQ to query the database and manipulate data

- How to use ModelState to handle form validation and display error messages to users
